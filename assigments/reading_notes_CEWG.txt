So many bad ideas in so few pages.

52: Admit that the method is not "scientific", but is rather a "resonably systematic manner to a collective judgement... informed by our won diverse experiences of what is likely to work better in practice and what is liely to work less well or not at all." 

53: They're looking for a "solution to the problem of underfunding and lack of a global coordination of pharmaceutical R&D"

53: The "principles to be enshrined" in the framework include:
- "a fair arrangement for burden-sharing... of costs" - basically cripples innovation
- "delinking the prices of medicines from the costs of R&D" - a fundament inversion of economic principles.  
- (54): That removing data exclusivity would "not adversely affect innovation incentives"
- "Direct grants to companies" but "accountability and governance criteria remain to be defined" 
- (55): Orphaned drug schemes and prize incentives (58), tax incentives (60) and transferable intellectual property rights (61) (which would actually use at least some market principles) is ruled out entirely
- (58): They favor open publishing approaches so as to "reduce duplication in research" - at a time when "reproducibility" in science is in crisis, they want less reproduction!
- They rule out "regulatory harmonization" (60) because of "lack of capacity in many regulatory authorities in developing countries" - that's the problem.  By ignoring it, you're simply further enabling the lack of capacity.
